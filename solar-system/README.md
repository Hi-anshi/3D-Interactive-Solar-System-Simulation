# ðŸŒŒ 3D Interactive Solar System Simulation

This project is a visually rich, interactive 3D simulation of our solar system. Built with React.js, Three.js, and Tailwind CSS, it allows users to explore all 8 planets orbiting the Sun, control animation speed, toggle dark/light mode, and interact with the scene using smooth camera controls. The simulation features realistic textures, orbit rings, a star field, and informative hover labels, making it both educational and engaging.

## ðŸš€ **Project Overview**

This project is a **real-time interactive 3D solar system simulation** built using **React.js**, **Three.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It visualizes:

- The **Sun at the center** with a realistic texture  
- **All 8 planets** (Mercury to Neptune) orbiting the Sun  
- Realistic **planet textures** and **orbit rings**  
- **Smooth animations** with adjustable speeds  
- **Interactive camera controls** (pan, zoom, rotate)  
- **Dark/Light mode toggle** with dynamic theming  
- **Hover labels** for each planet displaying names  
- **Pause/Resume** functionality for orbit animations
